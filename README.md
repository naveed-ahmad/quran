# Quran

This repository contains text and annotations of the Quran.

The corpus is modeled as a
[text-fabric data resource](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric)
which is optimized for processing the text as data.
This makes it easier to do all kinds of research on the text.

2019-01-07: the Quran TF-app and data and tutorials released.

**This is work in progress: we need to do more testing and documenting**


We have taken the source materials from
[Quranic Arabic Corpus 0.4 (2011) by Kais Dukes](http://corpus.quran.com)
and
[Tanzil](http://tanzil.net/docs/tanzil_project).

The data in
[tf format](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/Model/File-formats/)
